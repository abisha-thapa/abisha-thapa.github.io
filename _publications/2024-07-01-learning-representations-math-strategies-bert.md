We apply BERT pre-training to learn semantic representations of math strategies from large-scale student interaction data collected by an intelligent tutoring system. We fine-tune the learned embeddings on downstream classification tasks. Results show that BERT can uncover hidden structure in math strategies, producing representations that generalize across tasks and reveal semantic relationships between strategies.

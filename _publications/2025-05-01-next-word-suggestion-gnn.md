We exploit Graph Convolution operations in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode context for next word prediction. Our approach combines GNN-based context encoding with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context, leveraging the structural inductive biases of graph convolutions to capture rich contextual relationships in language.

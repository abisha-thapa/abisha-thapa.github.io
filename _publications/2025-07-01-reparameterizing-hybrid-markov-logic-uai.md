We propose a reparameterization of Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) to handle covariate-shift in learned representations. Our approach improves the robustness of HMLN-based models under distribution shift, enabling more reliable verification and inference over embeddings when the test distribution differs from training.

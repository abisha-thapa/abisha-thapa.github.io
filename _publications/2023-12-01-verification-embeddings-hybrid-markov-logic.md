We propose a framework based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) to specify properties over embeddings mixed with symbolic domain knowledge, and develop a verification method encoded as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The approach is illustrated across Graph Neural Networks, Deep Knowledge Tracing, and Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

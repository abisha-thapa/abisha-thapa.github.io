We address the challenge of validating explanations generated for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach assesses uncertainty in explanations by having the explainer generate outputs for counterfactual examples created as symmetric approximations of the relational structure in the original data. We employ a factor graph model to measure uncertainty levels in reported relationships. Testing across multiple datasets demonstrates our method can effectively verify explanations from GNNExplainer by reliably estimating the uncertainty of a relation specified in the explanation.

We investigate whether BERT-based language models can learn meaningful representations of math strategies from large-scale student interaction data. We pre-train and fine-tune BERT models on data collected from an intelligent tutoring system, evaluating learned representations on multiple downstream tasks. Our results show that language models can effectively capture and represent the structure of math strategies.
